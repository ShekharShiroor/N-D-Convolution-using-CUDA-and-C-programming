# N-D-Convolution-using-CUDA-and-C-programming

This program is my class assignment for CSC 196U at Sac State. The program demonstrates N-D Convolution operation done using CUDA and C.

The program uses shared memory and constant memory for optimized memory access form the GPU's global memory.

The mask size here is 5x5 and is a 2D mask
